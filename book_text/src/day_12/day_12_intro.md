# Day 12: Hill Climbing Algorithm
> Cursory look at breadth-first search
> Tree structures in Rust
Today's challenge doesn't introduce any new Rust patterns or constructs. The solution I implemented was a rather simple breadth-first search. However, this challenge does provide us with an opportunity to discuss [tree data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) in Rust. Much of this chapter will link to other, more knowledgeable discussions of the subject.
